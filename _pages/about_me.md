Hi, I am a passionate Software Developer/Architect who loves opensource software development. I write about Python, Django, and many other python's opensource software development tools and frameworks. I like to follow the widely accepted best practices while software development and encourage developers to do the same. I mostly worked professionally in Python. You can find my opensource work on Github [@abhijitbonik](https://github.com/abhijitbonik/){:target="_blank"}. For professional related work you can [mail]("mailto:abhijitbonik@gmail.com") me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijitbonik/){:target="_blank"}.

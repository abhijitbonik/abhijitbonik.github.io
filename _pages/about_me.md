Hi, I am a passionate Software Developer/Architect who loves opensource sofware development.
I write about Python, Django and many other python opensource software developement tools and frameworks. I like to follow the widely accepted best practices while development. I mostly worked professionally in Python. You find my opensource work on Github [@abhijitbonik](https://github.com/abhijitbonik/){:target="_blank"} or [Mail]("mailto:abhijitbonik@gmail.com") me or connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/abhijitbonik/){:target="_blank"}

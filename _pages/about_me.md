I am a Software developer having 4 years of experience in web development using Python language. During this period I have worked on different projects where frameworks like Django, Flask, FastAPI were used for development. I also have experience working on frontend frameworks like Angular and ReactJS in mosts of the projects. In many of the Python-based backend systems, I have implemented caching using Memcache and Redis, search index using Elasticsearch. In some of the systems, I have implemented SSO using SAML and OAuth protocols. You can find my opensource work on Github [@abhijitbonik](https://github.com/abhijitbonik/){:target="_blank"}.
